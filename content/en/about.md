description: "With a strong foundation in both back-end and front-end development, I possess the unique ability to bridge the gap between server-side logic and client-side experiences. As a self-taught programmer, my journey has been defined by versatility, enabling me to tackle a wide range of challenges, from IoT solutions to Web3 technologies, all while embracing the ethos of Open Source, Born and raised in Iran, I thrive on pushing the boundaries of whatâ€™s possibleâ€”whether it's through exploring the latest in serverless architectures, peer-to-peer app design, or the evolving world of blockchain and decentralized systems. My approach is rooted in continuous learning, collaboration, and a deep understanding of the intersection between technology and human experience."
