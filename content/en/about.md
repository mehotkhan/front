## About Me

I’m Ali Zemani, a developer with over a decade of experience crafting dynamic, scalable web applications, specializing in Nuxt.js and Vue.js. This blog is my space for exploration and reflection—a platform to share insights on technology, from modern web architectures like Jamstack and Web3 to cloud tools like Cloudflare.

For me, software development is more than coding—it’s a journey of discovery, solving challenges, and creating seamless digital experiences. As an open-source advocate, I’m passionate about collaborating with the developer community and sharing knowledge. Here, I invite you to join me in exploring emerging technologies, diving into technical deep-dives, or reflecting on science and creativity.

If you’re seeking inspiration, technical expertise, or just a conversation about tech, I’d love for you to come along.
