description: Get started with blockchain development with this step-by-step
  guide. This book takes you all the way from installing requisite software
  through writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts. Getting Started with
  Ethereum delves into technologies most closely associated with Ethereum, such
  as IPFS, Filecoin, ENS, Chainlink, Truffle, Ganache, OpenZeppelin, Pinata,
  Fleek, Infura, Metamask, and Opensea. Author Davi Bauer walks you through
  project creation, how to compile projects and contracts, configure networks,
  and deploy smart contracts on blockchains. He then covers smart contracts,
  including deploying and verifying them. This book approaches blockchain in a
  way that allows you to focus on the topic that most interests you, covering
  Ethereum-related technologies broadly and not just focusing on Solidity.

## Introduction

This book is a step-by-step guide for everyone who wants to get started
as an Ethereum developer. It was designed for those who have never
programmed anything in the blockchain and want to get started.
I will cover everything from the basic requirements of installation to
writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts. I will also cover topics such
as IPFS, Filecoin, ENS, Chainlink, Truffle, Ganache, OpenZeppelin, Pinata,
Fleek, Infura, MetaMask, and OpenSea, among others.

### Chapter 1

In Chapter 1, I will go through all the necessary requirements to start
the activities described in this book. It covers software and tools such as
Docker, Truffle, Ganache, MetaMask, and Infura.

### Chapter 2

In Chapter 2, you will learn how to create a basic Solidity project using
the VS Code extension and then compile and deploy the smart contract to
a local blockchain.

### Chapter 3

In Chapter 3, you will learn how to code smart contracts to create
your own coin and deploy it to a local blockchain. Fungible tokens are
interchangeable, so they are perfect to solve problems such as double
spending. You will also be able to add this token to your own wallet
and send it to different wallets, as well as send other coins that you
already have.

### Chapter 4

In Chapter 4, you will learn how to create a unit test file for a smart
contract, as well as write test assertions, run the unit tests, and check the
unit test results.

### Chapter 5

In Chapter 5, you will be able to create smart contracts for badge
tokens. You can use badge tokens, also known as NFTs, to represent
physical things in the virtual world, such as digital collectibles, game items,
digital art, etc. Each NFT token is unique and can have a unique value.
xvIntroduction In this chapter, you will learn how to code the smart contract with the help
of the OpenZeppelin library. You will also create the badge and add it to
IPFS node. After that, you will learn to pin it so it is available for everyone,
everywhere. Next, you will learn how to migrate the contract to different
environments such as a local blockchain using Ganache and testnets using
Infura. Finally, you will learn how to sell your own NFT on OpenSea.

### Chapter 6

In Chapter 6, we will cover different ways to fund your wallet using
faucets. This part is important because you will need some ether in your
wallet in order to pay for the transaction. Most of the examples will be
deployed on testnets so you wonâ€™t need real money to execute them.

### Chapter 7

In Chapter 7, you will learn how to create and save files on a
decentralized file system. I also cover some tools such as a browser
extension that will help you manage the node, as well as Pinata to help you
pin your files remotely instead of keeping them locally. In addition, you
will be able to host your own site on IPFS using Fleek.

### Chapter 8

In Chapter 8, I will cover ways to preserve files on a local node. The
idea behind Filecoin is the same of IPFS, with the difference that Filecoin
has an incentive mechanism and incentive nodes to preserve files. Filecoin
was built on top of IPFS.

### Chapter 9

In Chapter 9, you will learn how to register a custom domain on the
Ethereum Name System. You can use it to host a site under this domain
name or even as a domain for your wallet to receive cryptos, tokens,
or NFTs.

### Chapter 10

In Chapter 10, I will cover use cases where you need to pull data from
off-chain using oracles. You will learn how to use price feeds and then
crypto prices inside smart contracts.

### Chapter 11

In Chapter 11, you will learn how to create a simple project to connect
to Web3 using the .NET platform and how to retrieve data from the
blockchain to display wallet balances.

### Chapter 12

Chapter 12 concludes the book.
