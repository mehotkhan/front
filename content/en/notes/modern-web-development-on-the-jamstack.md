## Introduction

`From Book`

In just the past few years, a flurry of advancements has greatly strengthened the web as a content and application platform. Brows‐ ers are much more powerful. JavaScript has matured. WebAssembly is on the horizon. It certainly feels like the beginning of a new chap‐ ter for the web. You’ve likely felt this as you’ve witnessed the explo‐ sion of new frontend frameworks and API-based services.

Although what’s technically possible in the browser has advanced, so
too have expectations for immediacy. Videos must play instantly.
Browser applications must launch faster than their desktop counter‐
parts. Users have become increasingly mobile and increasingly
impatient—we are all fed up with slow pages and we vote angrily
against them with the back button. (Google also seems to be losing
patience, and now factors site speed into its famous ranking algo‐
rithms.)

Broadly speaking, this book covers new, modern approaches to
building websites that perform as fast as possible. More concretely,
this book shows you how to run any web property, from simple sites
to complex applications, on a global Content Delivery Network
(CDN) and without a single web server. We introduce you to the
JAMstack: a powerful new approach for deploying fast, highly scala‐
ble sites and applications that don’t require traditional frontend
infrastructure. If you tend to feel delivering great websites should be
more about the craft of markup and JavaScript than server setup
and administration, you’ve found your book.

And, if you’ve ever struggled with any monolithic system or frame‐
work—wrestling with hosting, deploying changes, securing, and
scaling everything—you already understand why the JAMstack is
becoming so popular. It’s one of those rare shifts in the landscape
that delivers a productivity boost for developers and a large perfor‐
mance boost for users. The JAMstack is helping to bring about a
more secure, stable, and performant web that’s also more fun to
develop and create for.

Under this new approach, there isn’t a “server environment” at all—
at least not in the traditional sense. Instead, HTML is prerendered
into static files, sites are served from a global CDN, and tasks that
were once processed and managed server side are now performed
via APIs and microservices.

We realize that seasoned web developers might eye anything new
with quite a bit of skepticism. There have certainly been countless
other new ideas on how to build the web before. For nearly three
decades, the developer community has explored ways to make the
web easier and faster to develop, more capable, more performant,
and more secure.

At times, though, the effort has seemed to trade one goal for
another. Wordpress, for example, became a revolution in making
content easier to author—but anyone who’s scaled a high-traffic
Wordpress site knows it also brings a whole set of new challenges in
performance and security. Trading the simplicity of HTML files for
database-powered content means facing the very real threats that
sites might crash as they become popular or are hacked when
nobody is watching closely.

And dynamically transforming content into HTML—each and every
time it’s requested—takes quite a few compute cycles. To mitigate all
the overhead, many web stacks have introduced intricate and clever
caching schemes at almost every level, from the database on up. But
these complex setups have often made the development process feel
cumbersome and fragile. It can be difficult to get any work done on
a site when you can’t get it running and testable on your own laptop.
(Trust us, we know.)

All these challenges have led the developer community to begin
exploring the JAMstack as a modern refactoring of the way websites
are developed and served. And like any good refactoring, you’ll find
that it both advances and simplifies the stack.
Being web developers ourselves, the authors of this book are more
excited by the JAMstack than we’ve been about any emerging trend
for quite a while. That’s because it uniquely solves for all these com‐
mon problems—developer experience, performance, and security—
all at the same time, and all without one compromising the other. To
us, it feels like the logical future of the platform.

It just makes sense.

Developer Jonathan Prozzi said it best on Twitter: “My learning
journey leading to #JAMstack has re-ignited my interest and passion
for web technology.” We think the JAMstack can do a lot to rekindle
your own enthusiasm, too, and we’re eager to welcome you to the
growing community of JAMstack practitioners. You’ll find develop‐
ing for the web has become fun and fearless all over again.
